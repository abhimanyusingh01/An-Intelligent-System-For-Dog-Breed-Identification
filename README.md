An Intelligent System For Dog Breed Identification

The aim of this project is to classify dog breeds from photographs or simply by the face of dogs. This is a fine grained and well defined classification issue: all Canis lupus breeds intimate share similar body features and overall structure, so identification and finding difference between breeds becomes a very huge problem. In addition, there is little inter breed variation and a lot of intra breed variation; in other words, there are little variations between breeds and a lot of differences within breeds, with colour, shape, and size differences. This dilemma is not only challenging, but it also has implications for other fine grained classification issues. The methods used to solve this problem, for example, area fine grained classification problem can be solved using any number of groups with relatively little variance within them. In the natural world, an identifier like this may be used in biodiversity surveys, saving time and money for scientists doing research on the health and abundance of specific plant populations.
